# Learning Goals of Overall Project:
- Create small programs that utilize Generics.
- Handle files using java
- Showcasing features and characteristics of Generics.
- Eventually apply concepts to Data Structure concepts.

## Planned Data Structure Implementations:
- Implement LinkedList, then Queue and Stack using inheritance.
- Implement Hashtable.
- Implement Binary Search Tree.
- Implement Red Black Tree.

## Main Java Packages:
- datastructures
- filehandling
- generics
- smallprojects

## File Folders:
- csvFiles, contains csv files
- textFiles, contains text files used by projects

# Small Projects:
simple GUI applications that modify files
