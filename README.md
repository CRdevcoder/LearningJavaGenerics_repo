# Learning Goals of Overall Project:
- Create small programs that utilize Generics, DataStructures, and file handling concepts.
- Handle files using java
- Showcasing features and characteristics of Generics.
- Eventually apply concepts to Data Structure concepts.

## Planned Data Structure Implementations:
- Implement LinkedList, then Queue and Stack using inheritance.
- Implement Hashtable.
- Implement Binary Search Tree.
- Implement Red Black Tree.

## Main Java Packages:
#### Learning Topic Packages
Each of these store tutorial packages, which contain classes that test out OOP concepts of their corresponding topic.
- datastructures
- filehandling
- generics
#### Small Project Package
This package stores simple projects that genrally apply the ideas from the topic packages.
- smallprojects

## File Folders:
- csvFiles, contains csv files
- textFiles, contains text files used by projects

# Small Projects:
simple GUI applications that modify files
- Java Notepad App
    - loads text files (Unimplemented)
    - saves changes to text files (Unimplemented)
